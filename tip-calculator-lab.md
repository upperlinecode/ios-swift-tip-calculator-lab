##Tip Calculator

Completed project code [here](https://github.com/upperlinecode/intro-to-swift/tree/master/day-6/TipCalculator)

###Description
Use what you've learned about TextField and UIPickerView objects to create a Tip Calculator. Follow these guidelines while building your app:
1. Use a text view where the user can enter a total cost for the meal.
2. Use a UIPickerView where the user can select the percentage that they want to tip.
3. Add a button that triggers an action which displays the correct tip and total amounts from the user input.
